2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
TIMING-16#1 Warning
Large setup violation  
There is a large setup violation of -3.627 ns between pwm_limit_reg[10]/C (clocked by sys_clk) and pwm_out_reg/D (clocked by sys_clk). Large setup violations at the end of those stages might be difficult to fix during the post-placement implementation flow and could be the result of non-optimal XDC constraints or non-optimal design architecture
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-18#1 Warning
Missing input or output delay  
An input delay is missing on RESET relative to the rising and/or falling clock edge(s) of sys_clk.
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-18#2 Warning
Missing input or output delay  
An input delay is missing on SW[0] relative to the rising and/or falling clock edge(s) of sys_clk.
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-18#3 Warning
Missing input or output delay
