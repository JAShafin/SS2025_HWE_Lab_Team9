FSM Diagram (Text):
- States: 0 to 7 (3-bit value)
- Inputs: up, down, rst
- At reset (rst=1): state -> 0
- up=1, down=0: state increases (next), wraps to 0 after 7
- up=0, down=1: state decreases (prev), wraps to 7 after 0
- up=down: state stays same
- Output: state as 3-bit, also shown on 7-segment display
